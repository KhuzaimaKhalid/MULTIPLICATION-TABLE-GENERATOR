# MULTIPLICATION-TABLE-GENERATOR
This C program generates multiplication tables for a user-defined number of base numbers. The user can specify how many base numbers they want to input and how many multiples of each base number should be displayed.

Features
Accepts multiple base numbers from the user.
Allows the user to specify how many multiples to generate for each base number.
Displays the multiplication tables for each base number in a formatted manner.
How It Works
The program starts by displaying a title message.
It prompts the user to enter the number of base numbers they wish to input.
It then prompts the user to enter how many multiples should be generated for each base number.
The program initializes an array to store the base numbers and a 2D array to store the multiplication tables.
It collects the base numbers from the user.
It calculates the multiplication tables by multiplying each base number by the integers from 1 to the specified number of multiples.
Finally, it prints the multiplication tables for each base number.
